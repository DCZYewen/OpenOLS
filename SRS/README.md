Thanks SRS project , we can reach such a good stream server .

We use SRS 3.0 beta as our main version .

You can just clone the SRS to here and compile it here .

Default configuration will do the job well , and user this folder's conf file .

And ! Dont forget to edit the conf , replace all `10.0.0.51` with your API url .
